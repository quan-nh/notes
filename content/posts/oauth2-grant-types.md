OAuth2 provides several `grant types` for different use cases.

### Authorization Code Grant

### Implicit Grant

Previously, it was recommended that browser-based apps use the "Implicit" flow, which returns an access token immediately in the redirect and does not have a token exchange step. The industry best practice has changed to recommend that the authorization code flow be used without the client secret.

### Client Credentials Grant
This grant is suitable for machine-to-machine authentication where a specific userâ€™s permission to access data is not required.
